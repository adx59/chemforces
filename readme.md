- segmented most of the problems from past USNCO opens between 2000 - 2015, except for 2010 -- 2010 is formatted weirdly, i really cba, if anyone wants to help me out please PR :) the extract.py code is really spaghetti but it gets the job done, im sorry about that
- really really baseline api with problem & page retrieval, along with random problem generation

# todo

- frontend
  - show problems, allow user to input answer
    - retrieve random problems as well as specified ones
  - time users on problems
  - probably use Bulma or something
- backend
  - scoring system
    - store persistent user scores
    - store problems user has already solved
    - probably use mongo
  - categorize problems -- send problem metadata in /problem
